<div id="why-over-60-of-consumers-use-the-same-brands-of-products-that-their-parents-did" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Why over 60% of consumers use the same brands of products that their parents did?</strong></h4>
<p>One of human predictable biases is ‘Status quo’ – resistance to change. Therefore, growing up with parents, consumers have created a strong behavior with brands that their parents used. And strong behavior is difficult to break. <!--more--> These brands have some attributes that other brands do not have. Based on ‘status quo’ and available heuristics (when consumers use their memory of actual instances to make judgment), it is difficult for consumers to get enough positive thoughts for unfamiliar brands that drive them to change their behavior easily.</p>
<p>Besides, due to the effect of framing, consumers are afraid of the losses unfamiliar brands bring to them much more than the gain they can get from those brands. Consumers even risk bigger risks just to prevent the small risks if new brands are truly much better than their current brands. With these reasons, over 60% of consumers use the same brands of products that their parents did.</p>

<h4><strong>When confronted with fewer brand choices, why consumers are more likely to purchase the product than if they have more choices?</strong></h4>
<p><img src="/img/consumer-insight/iphon6.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>“The more the merrier” – when stores have a lot of products, consumers are more encouraged to get into the store. However, in order to decide what to buy, consumers really struggle. When consumers have more choices, it becomes very difficult for them to process so many information to compare among brands, and come up with final choice. Consumers use heuristics and cognitive shortcuts to make ‘good-enough’ decisions. Besides, not all consumers have and understand complete, sufficient information to process and make decision in small amount of time.</p>
<p>It has been proven that the optimal point for number of products is 6 to 8. Personally speaking, it also depends on the type of products or services that we may end up 6, 7 or 8. When there are less than 6 to 8 options, it is easier for consumer to make decisions. When there are over 6 to 8 options, consumers start to feel overwhelmed. They then use “short-cuts” to make good-enough decisions, which they may or may not like. In case they don’t like it, this particular experience can act as an available heuristic to prevent them from choosing the product/brand next time.</p>
<p>Besides, having less choices enhance the scarcity of the available products/brands, then enhance the attractiveness of them and lastly, enhance the likeliness of consumers to buy the products.</p>
<p>With reasons above, less than 6 to 8 choices will increase consumer’s ability to make buying decisions, and increase the likeliness of them to purchase the product.</p>
<p>A great example is Apple. No doubt, Apple is one of the strongest brands in the World. It does not only make simple design but also simplify consumer decision process.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why Apple stops presenting and selling its old iPhone versions on Apple.com? It tries to keep consumer’s choice less than 6 to 8 products at a time. Without financial constraint, when choosing a new smartphone, consumers definitely spend less time deciding to buy an iPhone compared to buy other Android phones.</p>

<h4><strong>To try to reduce the theft of wood from Arizona’s Petrified Forest National Park, rangers put out signs that said, “Many past visitors have removed petrified wood from the Park, changing the natural state of the Petrified Forest.” Instead of decreasing theft, it led to nearly an 8% increase in wood theft. Why this happened?</strong></h4>
<p><img src="/img/consumer-insight/Petrified-Forest-National-Park.jpg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>This attempt at a nudge failed because it did not bring any incentive to visitors: “changing the natural state of the Petrified Forest” doesn’t show how this change affects their life – in a good or bad way, therefore doesn’t easily get unconsciously processed through visitors’ heuristic mind. Besides, this sign failed to help visitor understand mapping. Not all visitors know what the current state of the Petrified Forest is and therefore, they could not emotionally link themselves with the state of the forest.</p>
<p>Due to availability heuristics, human uses memory of actual instances for his/her judgment. Obviously, in front of their eyes and their memory of the wood, there are still a lot of wood in the Park and there is no way that the natural state of the Petrified Forest has been changed. And because visitors weren’t clarified if removing petrified wood from the park does harm or benefit to the Park itself, they still choose to keep removing (for them, the loss now is not taking the wood: if past visitors have removed wood before, it has to benefit them in some ways.)</p>

<div id="why-sushi-restaurants-might-price-by-the-piece-even-though-bundling-products-into-single-units-tends-to-sell-better" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Why sushi restaurants might price by the piece, even though bundling products into single units tends to sell better?</strong></h4>
<p><img src="/img/consumer-insight/consumer-bev_main.jpg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Sushi is a fancy food, usually made with fresh seafood. Based on a wine study of Plassmann, O’Doherty, Shiv and Rangel, if certain products are priced higher, they receive higher expectation from consumers, leading to higher satisfaction of them. In this case, sushi restaurants price sushi by piece instead of bundling products into a single unit in order to not devalue the sushi, especially when seafood in the U.S usually has higher price than meat. It’s also an effect of priming: when consumers are shown the price first, they naturally believe it tastes better. Another heuristic can be representativeness: people perceive products with higher price should correlate with higher quality. Therefore, sushi restaurants might price by piece, and this way helps consumers believe in a tasty and fresh sushi they consume.</p>
<p>So next time you go to a sushi bar, make sure you choose a truly good one. Don’t let your heuristic fools you ;)</p>
