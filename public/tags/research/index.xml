      <description>For many data analysis beginners, there seems to be so many stories we can tell from a data set, but too little time we have to analyze data and tell those stories in a reader-friendly way.

      <description>Why over 60% of consumers use the same brands of products that their parents did? One of human predictable biases is ‘Status quo’ – resistance to change. Therefore, growing up with parents, consumers have created a strong behavior with brands that their parents used. And strong behavior is difficult to break. These brands have some attributes that other brands do not have. Based on ‘status quo’ and available heuristics (when consumers use their memory of actual instances to make judgment), it is difficult for consumers to get enough positive thoughts for unfamiliar brands that drive them to change their behavior easily.</description>
