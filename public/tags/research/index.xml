      <description>For many data analysis beginners, there seems to be so many stories we can tell from a data set, but too little time we have to analyze data and tell those stories in a reader-friendly way. Undoubtedly, many of us find ourselves lost in a middle of data maze, confusing what is the most effective strategy to tackle with this complexity. The secret sauce to solve this is no secret, since it has been stated in many articles or textbooks: Defining project objectives before you proceed with your analysis.</description>

      <description>Why over 60% of consumers use the same brands of products that their parents did? One of human predictable biases is ‘Status quo’ – resistance to change. Therefore, growing up with parents, consumers have created a strong behavior with brands that their parents used. And strong behavior is difficult to break.  These brands have some attributes that other brands do not have. Based on ‘status quo’ and available heuristics (when consumers use their memory of actual instances to make judgment), it is difficult for consumers to get enough positive thoughts for unfamiliar brands that drive them to change their behavior easily.</description>

      <description>Among eleven top-rated Super Bowl commercials from 1989 to 2015, there are two commercials that give me the most impression. The first one is “2004: Bud Light - Owners demonstrate how their dogs fetch Bud Light”. The second one is “1994: Pepsi - A chimp experiment goes awry”. These two commercials have both similar and different techniques to nudge viewers, becoming so popular among them.
 Commercial Summary The Bud Light commercial is about two guys and his two dogs.</description>
