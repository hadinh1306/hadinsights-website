      <description>&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

      <description>I travelled to Sydney, Australia during December 2016 for 10 days. It was for a study abroad trip with University of Cincinnati, Department of Economics to learn about economics of immigration. Besides knowledge of immigration problems and how Australia’s government is dealing with them, I gained great consumer insights through conversations and observation. 
Sydney is such a vibrant and metropolitan city with (especially) so many Asian. As a big fan of culinary, I discovered some café and restaurants around the city.</description>
