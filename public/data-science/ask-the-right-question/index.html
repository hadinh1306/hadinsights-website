<h2><strong>A little story</strong></h2>
<p><img src="/img/data-science/vancouver_99bline.jpg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>I just moved to Vancouver recently, for my Master of Data Science at University of British Columbia. On my way home from a brunch meeting, I met a stranger lady on the bus. She started the conversation:</p>
<!--more-->
<blockquote>
<p>Lady: “Hey, do you know if I can take Sky Train from Broadway City Hall to Broadway-Commercial station? Please let me know, I’m in a hurry.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My brain started to analyze her question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My Brain: “Where is Broadway City Hall? Is it a building, or a station?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My Brain: “We’re on the 99 bus, which will take us to Broadway-Commercial station? So will she go to Broadway City Hall first, then go to Broadway-Commercial? Or does she want to go to Broadway-Commercial from here?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a good 7 minutes of <em>Q&amp;A session</em>, I finally understood her ultimate goal: She has an appointment at 12:45pm near Broadway-Commercial station. It was almost the time, so she wanted to reach there as fast as possible. And also knew that she doesn’t have data on her phone to check routes on Google Map.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-problem-is" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>The problem is…</strong></h2>
<p><img src="/img/data-science/ds_question_meme.jpg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>It is not only the stranger lady who asks questions based on her solution (that she - with all of her available information, thought to be the best choice at that moment), but also many of us who unconsciously do so. <strong>We skip the most important part - telling our goal or problem.</strong></p>
<p>If the lady whom I met on the bus told me her ultimate purpose of getting to the meeting point as fast as possible, I would have had assured her that she was on the right bus, and my brain would not spend time analyzing the unnecessary details like “Broadway City Hall” or “whether she goes to City Hall before Broadway-Commercial station”.</p>
</div>
<div id="before-you-ask" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Before you ask</strong></h2>
<p>To give the right questions and save time for people whom you ask, remember:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>They don’t know what is the ultimate goal you want to reach. So they might give a totally unrelated answer.</p></li>
<li><p>People might have different information from yours. So their way of thinking might be different from yours, and that may lead to a better solution to your problem.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="solution" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Solution</strong></h2>
<p><em>Summary for those who jump to this part without reading everything else: Many of us ask questions based on our solution to a problem to justify that solution, instead of telling about our problem first. This is an inefficient practice since people whom we ask might give unrelated answers or have better solutions to that problem.</em></p>
<p><img src="/img/data-science/ds_question_meme2.jpg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>To ask the right questions, that is an art.</p>
<p>Below is a quick guideline for asking right questions, following by my example on the bus.</p>
<div id="if-youre-the-one-who-ask-question." class="section level4">
<h4>If you’re the one who ask question.</h4>
<table class="table table-striped table-condensed table-responsive" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left;">
Step
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
Details
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
Example
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Step 1
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Tell them your problem, the ultimate goal you want to reach.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
I have a meeting near Commercial-Broadway station at 12:45 pm. I want to find the fastest route to reach there.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Step 2
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Tell them your constrains – what things keep you from reaching the goal.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
I have no data on my phone to search on Google Map.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Step 3
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Tell them your solution(s). Now is the time you can justify your solution(s) if you want.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
I know there is a train station near here – Broadway City Hall station. I think I might go by train from that station, it might be faster. Can you check if it’s correct?
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you are in a hurry and need the answer quickly, skip step 3.</p>
</div>
<div id="if-youre-the-one-who-get-asked" class="section level4">
<h4>If you’re the one who get asked</h4>
<table class="table table-striped table-condensed table-responsive" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left;">
Step
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
Details
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
Example
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Step 1
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Ask about their problem, or their goals.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Do you want to get to Commercial-Broadway station from here? Or you will go to Broadway City Hall first and then to Broadway-Commercial? You mentioned that you’re in a hurry, what time do you need to be there?
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Step 2
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Ask about their constrains, anything that keeps them from reaching the goal.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
If you have data on your phone, you can check on Google Map because I don’t have the answer on top of my head right now. If you don’t have data, I can help you find the route on my phone.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Step 3
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Justify their solution(s) and help them find the best solution.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
You cannot go from Broadway City Hall station to Commercial-Broadway by train. The fastest route, based on what I see in Google Map and Transit app is by Bus 99 – which we’re on now. So you can stay on this bus and get off at Commercial – Broadway station.
</td>

<p>This guideline is good for both personal and professional setting. Now, let’s go and practice asking questions!</p>
