<p>I travelled to Sydney, Australia during December 2016 for 10 days. It was for a study abroad trip with University of Cincinnati, Department of Economics to learn about economics of immigration. Besides knowledge of immigration problems and how Australia’s government is dealing with them, I gained great consumer insights through conversations and observation.

<p>Sydney is such a vibrant and metropolitan city with (especially) so many Asian. As a big fan of culinary, I discovered some café and restaurants around the city. Throughout my journey, I noticed many interesting facts that understanding demand and consumer behavior would explain.</p>

<h2><strong>1. Journey to find a Starbucks</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The watery taste can never be compared to the strong, Italian-style coffee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coming from US, where I can easily access to three Starbucks stores on campus and many more in 10-minute drive distance, I was amazed of how difficult it was for me to find a Starbucks store. I ended up seeing only 1 store during my 10-day trip. Curious of this shortage for Starbucks stores, I asked around and went on the Internet to found out. Apparently, Aussie doesn’t like the taste of Starbucks coffee. The watery taste can never be compared to the strong, Italian-style coffee that Australian adopted from Italian and Greek immigrants in the early 1950s.</p>
<p>Starbucks entered Australia market in 2000. Just 8 years later, it lost $143 million and was forced to close 60 stores, including 5 out of 9 stores in Sydney. Part of the problem is because of the bombarding number of stores in a short time that did not allow the market to get used to it. Charging a premium price and offering a <a href="https://www.marketingmag.com.au/news-c/can-a-local-operator-succeed-where-starbucks-failed-in-australia-by-opening-more-stores/#.VFVxhfmUcXc">questioning service</a> where customers already had a <a href="https://munchies.vice.com/en_us/article/4xb9gd/this-is-why-australians-hate-starbucks">strong coffee-culture</a> did not help much for the situation.</p>

<h2><strong>2. A dish is an art, not just a meal</strong></h2>
<p>First bite – I thought I was in heaven. Second bite and even the very last bite – I still stayed in my heaven.</p>
<p>Wandering around Sydney, from business district, to Vietnamese town, I realized how diverse coffee stores and restaurants are in this city. I came in Black Star Pastry in The Galeries building. The store is located inside Kinokuniya Bookstore with 3 small tables and a counter for around 5 chairs – pretty small sitting area. I arrived in a week-day afternoon with Long – my best friend in middle school who has been studying in Sydney since highschool. There was a long line of exciting customers who pointed at the small pastry window. They were waiting for the same thing I looked for – the famous Watermelon Strawberry Cake.</p>
