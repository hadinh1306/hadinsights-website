      <description>Among eleven top-rated Super Bowl commercials from 1989 to 2015, there are two commercials that give me the most impression. The first one is “2004: Bud Light, “Owners demonstrate how their dogs fetch Bud Light”. The second one is “1994: Pepsi, “A chimp experiment goes awry”. These two commercials have both similar and different techniques to nudge viewers, becoming so popular among them.
##Commercial Summary
The Bud Light commercial is about two guys and his two dogs.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.
