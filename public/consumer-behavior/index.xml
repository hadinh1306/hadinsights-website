      <description>I travelled to Sydney, Australia during December 2016 for 10 days. It was for a study abroad trip with University of Cincinnati, Department of Economics to learn about economics of immigration. Besides knowledge of immigration problems and how Australia’s government is dealing with them, I gained great consumer insights through conversations and observation. 
Sydney is such a vibrant and metropolitan city with (especially) so many Asian. As a big fan of culinary, I discovered some café and restaurants around the city.</description>

      <description>Why over 60% of consumers use the same brands of products that their parents did? One of human predictable biases is ‘Status quo’ – resistance to change. Therefore, growing up with parents, consumers have created a strong behavior with brands that their parents used. And strong behavior is difficult to break. These brands have some attributes that other brands do not have. Based on ‘status quo’ and available heuristics (when consumers use their memory of actual instances to make judgment), it is difficult for consumers to get enough positive thoughts for unfamiliar brands that drive them to change their behavior easily.</description>
